# AI Assistant Architecture Recommendations

## 1. Goals and High-Level Requirements

The assistant’s purpose is to reduce cognitive overhead for leaders managing multiple projects.  
It should:

- Ingest semi-structured data: **emails, calendar events, meeting notes, training records, quick summaries**.  
- Maintain **long-term context** across projects, people, and timelines.  
- Generate **digests, reminders, and risk alerts**.  
- Highlight what’s **urgent, slipping, or upcoming**.  
- Provide **daily and weekly views** of priorities.  
- Scale from single-user (MVP) → multi-tenant (productized SaaS).

## 2. Technical Architecture (At Scale)

### 2.1 Core Layers
- **Data Ingestion Layer**  
  Connectors for Gmail, Google Calendar, Slack/Teams, and manual note capture.  
  Example: Gmail API for threads, Calendar API for events, or Zapier-style hooks.  

- **Storage Layer**  
  - **Relational DB (Postgres/Supabase)** for structured entities: projects, tasks, meetings, notes, people.  
  - **Vector DB (pgvector, Qdrant, Weaviate)** for embeddings → fast semantic retrieval.  

- **Processing Pipeline**  
  - **Ingestion jobs** normalize external data into entities.  
  - **Scheduled jobs** (cron) generate digests, update project risk scores, and send reminders.  

- **AI Core (RAG)**  
  Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) grounds the LLM with project context:  
  - Embed incoming text → store in vector DB.  
  - At query time: retrieve relevant chunks → pass into the LLM prompt.  
  This ensures outputs stay accurate and personalized [oai_citation:0‡file:///home/oai/redirect.html](file:/home/oai/redirect.html).  

- **Orchestration & Memory**  
  - **LangChain**: strong orchestration, tool usage, advanced memory.  
  - **LlamaIndex**: excels at ingestion + index building from diverse sources [oai_citation:1‡file:///home/oai/redirect.html](file:/home/oai/redirect.html).  
  - **Semantic Kernel**: plugin-oriented workflows, good for enterprise extensibility.  

- **Interfaces**  
  - **Backend (NestJS API)** deployed as container (Cloud Run).  
  - **Frontend (Next.js/Analog)** deployed on Vercel.  
  - **Integrations** via REST/gRPC or tRPC.  

---

### 2.2 Risk & Priority Scoring
Projects get a **risk score** based on signals:
- Overdue tasks (+10 each).  
- Tasks due <72h (+5 each).  
- Notes tagged `risk` in last 7d (+7 each).  
- No updates/meetings in 14d (+5 stagnation).  

Projects flagged `AT_RISK` above a threshold (e.g. score ≥25).  

---

### 2.3 Scheduling & Notifications
- **Daily Digest (06:00)**: “Today’s meetings, urgent tasks, risks, 2x deep-work slots.”  
- **Weekly Digest (Friday PM)**: “This week’s accomplishments, risks to address next week.”  
- Delivery: email (Resend), Slack DM, or calendar event notes.

---

## 3. Frameworks and SDKs

- **LangChain**  
  - Best for **agent orchestration** and chaining multiple tools.  
  - Rich ecosystem of memory modules and retrieval integrations [oai_citation:2‡file:///home/oai/redirect.html](file:/home/oai/redirect.html).  

- **LlamaIndex**  
  - Best for **data ingestion + indexing** across diverse sources.  
  - Strong connectors (LlamaHub) for Gmail, Calendar, Slack, Notion, etc.  

- **Semantic Kernel (Microsoft)**  
  - Focused on **plugins and workflows**.  
  - Useful when integrating into enterprise systems.  

- **OpenAI / Vertex AI SDKs**  
  - **OpenAI**: reliable embeddings + GPT-4o for summaries/digests.  
  - **Vertex AI**: alternative for compliance + data residency.

## 4. Plain English Breakdown

Think of this assistant as a **personal Chief of Staff**:

- Every note, email, or meeting you feed it gets **filed away** under the right project.  
- It keeps a quiet **scoreboard** of which projects look healthy vs. risky.  
- Each morning, it says:  
  - “Here are today’s meetings and prep notes.”  
  - “Here are the top 3 things that need your focus.”  
  - “This project looks like it’s slipping — check in with the team.”  
- Each week, it helps you **plan, reflect, and prioritize**.  

The goal: less time juggling context, more time focusing on leadership, coding, and strategy.  

---

## 5. Scaling Considerations

- **Multi-Tenancy**  
  - Each company/org has its own schema or row-level filters.  
  - Vector DB namespaces per org → clean separation of embeddings.  

- **Observability**  
  - **Langfuse** or **OpenTelemetry** to track LLM prompts, responses, costs.  
  - Logging/metrics in GCP (Cloud Logging + Cloud Trace).  

- **Security**  
  - OAuth for Gmail/Calendar ingestion.  
  - Secrets in GCP Secret Manager.  
  - TLS everywhere (Vercel/Cloud Run handle this by default).  

- **Flexibility**  
  - Modular, microservice-friendly design.  
  - Each service (ingestion, risk scoring, digest generation) can be broken out later as independent Cloud Run services.  

---

## 6. Why These Decisions?

- **NestJS** for backend → consistent structure, decorators, DI, testability.  
- **Supabase Postgres + pgvector** → one system for relational + vector needs (fast to start).  
- **LangChain + LlamaIndex combo** → best balance between ingestion and orchestration.  
- **Cloud Run + Vercel** → minimal ops, autoscaling, fast to deploy.  
- **Resend + Slack notifications** → quick, reliable delivery.  
- **RAG** → keeps the assistant grounded in your data, avoids hallucinations.

## 7. Path from MVP → Product

- **MVP (today):**  
  - NestJS API on Cloud Run.  
  - Supabase with pgvector.  
  - Gmail + Calendar ingest.  
  - Daily digest email.  

- **Phase 2 (internal tool):**  
  - Risk scoring + weekly digests.  
  - Web dashboard (Next.js).  
  - Slack integration.  

- **Phase 3 (productize):**  
  - Multi-tenant orgs.  
  - Managed vector DB (Qdrant/Weaviate).  
  - Company-wide AI agent (aggregated insights).  
  - Usage tracking + billing.

# Conclusion

This architecture is **pragmatic today** (you can stand it up fast with Cloud Run + Supabase) and **scalable tomorrow** (swap out components as you grow). It balances developer productivity with long-term productization potential.

In plain terms: it’s a **second brain for your leadership role** — always on, always tracking context, surfacing what matters before you drop the ball.
